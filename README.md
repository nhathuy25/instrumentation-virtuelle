Jules TOUPIN, Huy NGUYEN, Lina EL MEKAOUI, Khoa VU

## About the project
This project is a part of our's work for an application for measuring of a displacement field by doppler-laser velocimetry done with 4 groups (17 members of engineering student in total) INSA CVL ACAD 2024-2025. The program is developed and expanded every year by our student.

In this year, we update the code and re-defined the functions to control both the laser and camera attached to the device based on the last work of previous student.
